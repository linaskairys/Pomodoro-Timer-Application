# Pomodoro-Timer-Application
This is a simple pomodoro application. It involves using CSS to design an interface with an apple in the center of the screen, containing a clock and three buttons. These buttons control the start, stop, and pause functionalities of the timer. The timer runs for 25 minutes, after which it alerts the user to take a short break.
